# Starbucks Locations Analytics
<img src="">

### Overview:

When first learning how to code I would always go to Starbucks for a great coffee. Yes many would choose the franchise because of it's popularity. Others like myself went because it was very accessible. Since then I've been a major fan I always wanted to find more shops to visit while traveling. While observing the data I noticed that many locations are out there. I wanted to get more insight of the locations in the United States for Atlanta, Charlotte and LA.


### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Tableau 
- Jupyter Notebook
